â””â”€â”€ README.md                   # This file
```

### Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   make deps
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export ALPACA_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   export ALPACA_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
   ```

3. **Build and Run** (using Makefile):
   ```bash
   # Build the application
   make build
   
   # Or build and run in one command
   make run
   
   # Or just run (if already built)
   make run-only
   ```

4. **Alternative Manual Build**:
   ```bash
   cd backtesting
   go build -o artemis-backtest ./cmd
   ./artemis-backtest
   ```

### CSV Input Format

The application reads stock signals from `backtesting/data/example/stock_signals.csv`:

```csv
ticker,buydate,selldate
AAPL,2024-01-15,2024-02-15
GOOGL,2024-01-20,2024-02-20
```

### Output

The application provides comprehensive backtesting results including:

- **Basic Backtest Results**: Simple buy-and-hold performance
- **Enhanced Strategy Comparison**: Performance of all 5 strategies
- **Individual Signal Results**: Detailed results for each signal
- **Performance Metrics**: Win rates, average returns, hold times, and annualized returns

### Strategy Details

1. **Basic Buy & Hold**: Traditional buy at signal date, sell at target date
2. **Staggered Entry**: 80% position at buy date, 20% during first week dips
3. **Take Profit + Trailing Stop**: Take profit at 15% gain, then 15% trailing stop
4. **Simple Trailing Stop**: 15% trailing stop from entry
5. **Staggered Entry + Trailing Stop**: Combines staggered entry with trailing stop

### Dependencies

- `github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-go/v2` - Alpaca trading API
